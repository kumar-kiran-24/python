    "#  OOP\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable and scalable applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Features of OOP in Python:\n",
    "Organizes code into classes and objects\n",
    "Supports encapsulation to group data and methods together\n",
    "Enables inheritance for reusability and hierarchy\n",
    "Allows polymorphism for flexible method implementation\n",
